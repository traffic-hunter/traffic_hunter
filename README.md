## Intro. Traffic-Hunter

**Traffic-Hunter** is APM (Application Performance Management) 


- `Real-Time Monitoring`: Capture and visualize application metrics and transaction logs in real-time.


- `Easy Configuration`: Easily configure the agent using a simple YAML file, making setup straightforward and user-friendly.


- `Efficient Data Storage`: Leverages [**TimescaleDB**](https://www.timescale.com/) for efficient storage and querying of time-series data, 
   enabling high-performance analytics on metrics and traces.


- `Visualization`: This APM leverages [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) for powerful and customizable visualization of metrics and transaction logs, enabling real-time insights and easy integration into your observability stack.


- `Zero-Code`: Traffic Hunter Agent uses **Java Instrumentation** to modify bytecode at runtime, requiring no code changes from users. Simply attach the agent, and it automatically tracks metrics and traces with zero configuration.
